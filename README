Easy Sheets is a scheduling management application for places of work. Each employee/manager is able to login to see their schedule for the week and edit their
information. Depending on the employee type, they may be able to use the manager page to add new employees and set schedules.

Known bugs: The program does not have any checks on the information that is inputted by the user. As a result, the user may set/change their names to anything
that is not neccessarily a string. This won't break the program, but it would not make sense to have the information in this way.

Login info (all logins are in login.properties)
	Manager login - Username: vjr976 Password: arriba
	Employee login - Username: sur987 Password: ps

Other requirements: The paths of some images and fxml files may need to be altered. For the images, simply change the image views on SceneBuilder accordingly.
